Simply replaces the Tix in Roblox with the old currency, Tix. NOTE : In search, you still have to type "Tix" but the results will say "Tix" instead the usual "Tix" text. However, maybe I went a bit overboard when I decided to change any username that contained the word "Tix" to remove the word "Tix" and replace it with "Tix" because it makes me feel like I changed the past and Tix was never invented.
